# AggrEmoji
  - a simple, web-scraping emoji aggregator tool for upping your workplace chat    
    emoji game

----------

### Basics
* Ruby version
  - 2.6.3

* License
  - CC0 1.0 Universal Creative Commons License
  
* Right Away
  - `bundle install`
  
* To Run
  - input `ruby bin/run.rb` from root level directory
  - follow prompts and (hopefully) aggregate some emoji (you'll just get to see it in the pry for now :/)

* How to run the test suite
  - `rake spec` from root directory
  - `rake spec #{test-name?}` to run targetted tests (? - please confirm) (<-- no app specific tests yet)
  - (the 15 passing tests are on a generic, non-functionining 'Widget' object)
  
* Current build only scrapes this url:
  -  https://slackmojis.com/categories/19-random-emojis
   and returns different versions of lists featuring the **8668** results (currently only within your `binding.pry`)
