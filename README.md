* Current build only scrapes this url:
  -  https://slackmojis.com/categories/19-random-emojis
   and returns ~~different versions of lists featuring the **8668** results (currently only within your `binding.pry`)~~ the data into a .csv called 'data' located here: `lib/utility/data.csv` --> the pry's are still in code, comment them back in to see the lists mentioned <
   
* To clear your local .csv file
  - `ruby bin/clear.rb`
